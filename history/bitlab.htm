The Bit Lab is student built and run computer lab. &nbsp; The computer
students have built high end PCs, installed Linux operating systems and
networking. &nbsp;The lab is a playground for computer students run web
servers, stereo projection graphics, advanced programming and anything
else
we can think of.<br>
<br>
In the beginning (1999), the Bit Lab was just an idea. &nbsp;We had
a&nbsp;<a href="proposal/bitlabproposal.htm">
proposal</a>, a vision for what it could be. &nbsp;It's gratifying to
see how much of our current reality is a fulfillment of this dream.<br>
<br>
In Spring 2003, we built the Bit Lab computers. &nbsp;Here are some <a
 href="../pictures/building2003/building.htm">pictures</a>
from that.. &nbsp;<br>
<p>Part of installation includes a <a href="stereo/stereo.htm">stereo</a>
projection system. &nbsp;We can't show you what you SEE through the
system,
because this web page is mono and so probably is your monitor.
&nbsp;You'll
have to come visit to see it.<br>
