<h1>
The Bit Lab at Meredith (proposed)</h1>
Meredith college has a number of computer labs, but there is no lab where
computer students can maintain hardware, install software, manage the network
and do large programming projects. I hope that The Bit Lab will be such
a place.

<td><b>The students in </b>the Math and Computer Science department have
access to school labs with PCs and lots of user-software. Many student
have machines and soon they all will. There is a campus network with email
and a web server, and we now have Blackboard. So what could be missing?
<p><b>At present, </b>the hard drives in the lab are read-only, and thus
so are all the programs. Students use data files on floppies. This is ok
for most students, but computer students are not just computer users; they
are computer makers. They need to be able to deal with programs too, not
just data. And floppies are too small and slow to work efficiently (or
at all some times), even at a beginning level.&nbsp;
<p><b>We want a place where </b>where computer students can learn to manage
computers, upgrade hardware, play with operating systems, install software,
set up a network, get email working or host a web site. We need a facility
for high-power computing, computer graphics, sound processing, animation
and other large programming problems. This high-touch environment is especially
needed for women students, who are frequently elbowed out of the way in
high school by their male classmates and may thus be lacking in hands-on
experience.
<p><b>The answer I propose is The Bit Lab. </b>I propose a lab with 6-10
high powered machines, assembled and managed by students. The lab will
serve as home territory for math and computer students for projects, experiments
with new technology, undergraduate research ... anything the students want.
My experience with a lab of this sort is that students get excited when
it's really theirs to make good. In a previous lab like this that I helped
create, students with little supervision installed the whole lab, performed
upgrades, cloned machines, tried out strange operating systems, created
web sites and programmed spectacular graphics, intelligent game programs,
etc..&nbsp;
<p><b>The extra benefits </b>from a lab like this are that students get
a sense of ownership and responsibility. Students learn what it's like
to manage a real lab. They learn leadership, policy making, team work,
and they develop an identity as a group. It's the kind of place students
will strive to get into and will work to keep. (i.e., recruitment and retention.)
And students who learn IT skills in The Bit Lab can then help our IT department
with the exploding computer population on campus.&nbsp;
<p><b>So far </b>we have 3 500Mhz PCs running Linux, assembled and installed
by students. It's a start. I am shooting for 6-10 fast PCs, <b>Linux </b>,
network switch, cables, a robotics toy kit, a couple of printers, a couple
of cameras, and a few other things. We are presently looking into funding
options. Email me if you want more information.&nbsp;</td>
