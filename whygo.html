<h2>Why on Earth would you go to an all women's college for Computer
Science?</h2>
by Barrett Koster, professor of Computer Science and stuff<br>
<br>
Will it help you get a job?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Will you learn better
among just women?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; Is this a convent?&nbsp; Oh please
-- the boys are just down the street.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want
to become somebody?&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do you?</span><br>
<br>
<h3>Did the tech bubble burst your job?&nbsp;&nbsp; </h3>
Heck no.&nbsp; The financial risk takers took a hit when they got
caught over-speculating, but the technology has never gone
away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your phone, your MP3 player, your computer ....
somebody has to make all this junk work, lots of
somebodies.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are more gadgets and technology every
day, and companies wonder how they are going to get enough people to
handle it all.<br>
<br>
CareerBuilder.com reports that "College students graduating in 2004-05
with a math- or science-related
degree are likely to earn significantly higher starting pay than their
peers in liberal arts disciplines, according to a spring salary survey
by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE)."&nbsp;

If your main concern is about getting a job, then Computer Science or
Computer Information Systems is still ahead of the English majors.<br>
<br>
<h3>But it's more than a job -- get the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">fun</span> back in your computer.</h3>
Do you remember when you thought the computer was kinda cool, before
your brother hogged it, before the guys at your highschool took over
and turned everything about them into either sex or explosions?&nbsp;
Did you know the first programmer was a woman?&nbsp; And there have
been lots since.&nbsp; Computers are just as much for women as
men.&nbsp;&nbsp; But studies have shown that women demand more meaning
from their programming; women want to have a purpose where guys are
content with doing things "for the hell of it".&nbsp; Is a mixed gender
school going to change their assignments to suit you?&nbsp; Some have,
but not many.&nbsp; We at Meredith obviously strive to make the work
relevant to women.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
And we usually have a good time in class.&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer are such
odd things, it's easy to find humor in just about everything.&nbsp; The
history is so recent that the heros and the villians are still in the
news.&nbsp; And the programs themselves -- failure is frequently
spectacular or at least really comical, and success is as sweet as it
gets, either doing it yourself or sharing with a team.<br>
<br>
Are you thinking of majoring in Art or French or Biology or Math?&nbsp;
Have
you <span style="font-style: italic;">tried</span> computers?&nbsp;
Some of my best students are into Art or French, but many
discover&nbsp; they love computers too late to major.&nbsp; Maybe
computers
won't work for you, but you really should at least try it.&nbsp; And
downloading music is a good skill, but if that's all the fartther
you've gotten, there's a new world waiting for you.<br>
<h3>Are you a 2nd class citizen?</h3>
Do you want to be able to build or upgrade your computer without some
guy elbowing you out of the way?&nbsp; Do you want to be able to ask
questions in class without the guys acting like they already know it
(and trust me, it's acting)?&nbsp; If you are a woman and have never
been in a place that is for women, you may never have known what it is
like to be a first class citizen.&nbsp; As a man, I have never known a
day without it, and I'll tell you it makes a difference.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
When I interviewed at Meredith, I could tell the women thought of
themselves differently <span style="font-style: italic;">before I even
got out of my car</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The way the students walked
across the street said that they belonged in a way that I'd never seen
women do before.&nbsp; Graduates of women's colleges occupy a
disproportionate number of the postions held by women in government and
as exectutives in industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The irony of some
parents sending their daughters here to be sheltered is that the
daughters become <span style="font-style: italic;">less</span> likely
to buy the traditional role as asisstant people.&nbsp; At mixed gender
schools, how many women become student government president, honor
council chair or even tech assistant?&nbsp; But at Meredith,&nbsp; they
all are.&nbsp; You get
used to it, the feeling of being top dog, and it's not something you
give up when you leave.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
<h3>In the end .....</h3>
Choosing a college is hard.&nbsp; Since you've read this far, you're at
least considering Meredith.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why don't you come for a visit
-- party in the Bit Lab!
