<font size="+2">Student Opportunities (</font>research
grants, internships, mentoring ....)
<p><a href="http://www.cra.org">CRA</a> is the Computer Research
Association.&nbsp;
The sub-group on women, <a href="http://www.cra.org/Activities/craw/">CRA-W</a>,
has several programs ... here are just a few of pointers:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.cra.org/Activities/craw/crew/index.html">CREU:</a>&nbsp;
grants of $1000-$2000 to groups of undergraduate women students for
research projects in computer science.&nbsp; Barrett Koster knows the
head
of this project and has helped her review proposals, so he can help you
make
a GOOD project proposal.&nbsp; Proposals are due some time in
April.&nbsp;&nbsp; The funding rate is better than most, so your odds
are good.&nbsp; Apply!&nbsp; See the site for details, and then talk
with Dr. Koster.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.cra.org/Activities/craw/dmp/index.html">DMP</a>
(Distributed
Mentor Project).&nbsp; Students are given a full ride 10-week summer
research
assistantship at a major research institution.&nbsp;&nbsp; All mentors
are female, and students get to try out working in a real environment
on
real problems.&nbsp; Three of Dr. Koster's students have been on one of
these, and
they each had a blast.</li>
  <li>
There are a number of other links on the CRA-W site, like Systers
(nominally,
women system programmers).&nbsp; Have a look.</li>
</ul>
Internships
