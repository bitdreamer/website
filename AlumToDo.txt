   todoID - number of item
   title - short lable of job
   description - full text of what needs to be done
   subDate - when we this submitted, requested to be done
   subPerson - who made this request.  this is going to depent on how
      people are identified in the system. 
   status - 1=submitted nothing yet, 2=progress, 3=done 4=approved?
   working - text talking about progress or whatever
   doPerson - who is working on this.  Maybe I should standardize the way
