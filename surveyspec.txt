We are supposed to survey CS alums "are they making good use of 
their computer skills?"

questions

-- where are you employed?  What is your job title?  What do you do?

-- are you using your computer skills in your current job?

-- do you feel Meredith helped you prepare for this?

-- what part of the CS program at Meredith was most valuable to you?

-- Do you have suggestions for improvement?

-- general comment .  Here is where you can explain stuff if you need to,
   like you got a job when you got out, but now you are between jobs
   or have elected to do stay home with kids or do something else.
