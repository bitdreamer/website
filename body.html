<h2> Welcome to the Bit Lab! </h2>

<p>  The Bit Lab is a
student-built Linux Lab for computer students.  We have class, 
write programs, do homework, make coffee and just hang
out.  See the links to the
left for more what it's like to be here, the projects,
the equipment, the history and the fun.

Could you be good at computers?  It's a lot more like what
you already do than you may realize.  Talk to a computer student
or Barrett Koster (kosterb-at-meredith.edu) to find out what 
it's really all about.
