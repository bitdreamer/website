<h2><a name="students"></a>WHAT&nbsp; STUDENTS&nbsp; SAY&#8230;</h2>
<h3>Why did you decide to major in CS or CIS?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I like to know how things work."</li>
  <li>"It's just so logical."</li>
  <li>"It wasn't what everyone else was doing, I wanted to be
different."</li>
  <li>"I've always been good at solving ... puzzles."</li>
</ul>
<h3>What's your favorite thing about being a CS or CIS major?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I enjoy the hands on experience.&nbsp; ....&nbsp; It's like
trying to solve a puzzle."</li>
  <li>"Getting to solve problems and create cool programs.&nbsp; I also
like that there are so many different ways to solve a problem, so your
answer doesn't have to be exactly like everyone else's."</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you wanted to major in computers, why didn't you go to a big
state school?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"I didn't want to be stuck in an auditorium with hundreds of
other students.&nbsp; If I went to NC State, I wouldn't have gotten the
experience of having my professors not only know my name, but also know
me."</li>
  <li>"The Faculty!!!!!"</li>
  <li>"Because I liked the small, close-knit community that Meredith
is&#8230; the classes are so small, it is so much easier to learn that way."</li>
  <li>"The faculty at Meredith have a really great attitude toward the
students.&nbsp; There's not this 'sink or swim, I don't care'
atmosphere&#8230; the material is just as challenging, but the professors
want students to succeed and are available and willing to help."</li>
  <li>"The combination of having small classes and having all women
makes a much easier environment for building confidence through gaining
skills.&nbsp; I wasn't 'into' computers growing up&#8230; I was starting from
ground zero.&nbsp; Some guys can be a little chauvinistic when it comes
to computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted a more cooperative atmosphere."</li>
</ul>
<h3>What do you think makes a person be "cut out" for CS or CIS?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"One who enjoys problem solving and refuses to give up."</li>
  <li>"I believe that it starts with a basic interest in computers. I
don't believe that you have to be a geek or a nerd if you want to learn
about computers."</li>
  <li>"Problem-solving, the ability to think on a detailed level, and
being interested in how things work.&nbsp; You don't necessarily have
to be a math type to be a good programmer or systems administrator (or
a lot of other really good computer jobs out there)."</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>What is the biggest myth about computer majors?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"That 'computer people' just eat and breathe computers, that it's
our whole life.&nbsp; In reality, we have tons of other interests and
activities as well."</li>
  <li>"I think that some people think that computer majors know
everything that there is to know about computers.&nbsp; I don't know
everything and I'm not trying to know everything."</li>
  <li>"[That] we are geeks... well, we are geeks, but we are cool
geeks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "</li>
  <li>"All we do is sit at the computer all day."</li>
  <li>"&#8230; that you have to be really into computers and technology to
enjoy programming.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyone can program - anyone who
understands logic."</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><a name="faculty"></a>WHAT&nbsp; FACULTY&nbsp; SAY&#8230;</h2>
<h3>What do you think makes a person be "cut out" for CS or CIS?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"For CS students, I look for attitude.&nbsp;&nbsp; CS people try
stuff, have the confidence to break things."</li>
  <li>"&#8230;interest in computers and how they work, enjoys or at least
does not hate using computers, an appreciation for using reason and
logic&#8220;</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the difference between Computer Science and Computer
Information Systems?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"CIS is more business and user oriented, and as such CIS people
are &#8230; usually more into the mechanisms of PEOPLE with computers as
helpers.&nbsp; CS people are more concerned about just the computer's
functions, what we can make the machine do.&nbsp; CS tends to be more
technical, mathy and sciencey."</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the biggest myth about computer majors?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>"[That] computer people are only interested in computers to the
exclusion of everything else in the universe."</li>
  <li>"The biggest myth about computer majors is that they are
antisocial.&nbsp; I think it's promulgated by guys who don't want to be
threatened&#8230;it's a punishment for a woman being smart&#8230;"</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2><a name="alumnae"></a>WHAT&nbsp; ALUMNAE&nbsp; SAY&#8230;</h2>
<ul>
  <li>"When I first came to Meredith, I never thought I would graduate
with a computer science degree.&nbsp; Now I can not imagine doing
anything else with my career!"</li>
  <li>"Dr. Rosso made me a major because he believed in me and saw
potential I overlooked!!!!"</li>
  <li>"CIS and CSC are challenging, but fun subjects. At Meredith you
get a state-of-the-art facility and very personal attention with small
class sizes. You get to know your professors and they know you and how
you code. The large state schools with more popular computer programs
have computers check your work, not a human. At Meredith you get real
feedback and learn to write neater, better code."</li>
  <li>"The CSC/CIS faculty [are] a huge reason to be a major!&nbsp;
They are personable, knowledgeable, and quite a bit silly."</li>
  <li>"My degree in computer science from Meredith more than adequately
prepared me for my graduate work in computer science.&nbsp; In fact
some of my graduate work was a review because the undergraduate studies
had been so comprehensive." </li>
  <li>"Computer science is not an easy field, but the program at
Meredith is hands-on and the individual attention you receive goes a
LONG way towards your understanding of the important concepts.&nbsp; I
would never have chosen computer science as my major if I had not been
at Meredith."</li>
  <li>"The computer science program at Meredith laid a solid foundation
for my career in computer science.&nbsp; I not only have the basic
building blocks, but I also gained the ability to learn new concepts on
my own and in a short amount of time.&nbsp; This skill is critical in
the computer science field where technology is constantly changing."</li>
  <li>"The hands-on experience in the computer labs at Meredith is very
valuable to me."</li>
  <li>"My undergrad in Computer Science from Meredith prepared me for
my Masters in Computer Science at N.C. State.&nbsp; The Computer
Science courses at Meredith created a very strong foundation for me."</li>
