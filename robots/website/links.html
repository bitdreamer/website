<br>
<p>This research project involves the LEGO MindStorms robots.  
We bought the educational package: LEGO MindStorms for Schools.
The robots come with their own software that enable you to program
 them and no previous programming knowledge is needed.  You can 
find more information about the LEGO MindStorms products at this site.</p>

</font>
<br>
<p>Since our goal is to program the LEGO MindStorms RCX with Java,
 we had to go search the web for a tool (aka firmware) that would
 allow us to do this. We found a couple different ones, and we 
decided to use leJOS. You can find more information and downloads 
for leJOS at this site.</p>

</font>
<br>
<p>Through our searches on the web, we also found TinyVM.
TinyVM is leJOS's predecessor.  It has been deemed officially
 inactive meaning they are not trying to make it a better and fuller
firmware such as leJOS.  You can find more information about TinyVM and,
 as a result, leJOS at this site.</p>

<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target="new">Java</a>
</font>
<br>
<p>To use leJOS and TinyVM you need to download Java which you can do
 at this site.  Java is a programming language.  It's a little tricky 
at first but once you understand the syntax, it's pretty easy to learn.</p>
