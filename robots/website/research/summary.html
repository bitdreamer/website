Over the past eight weeks, we have learned a lot about the LEGO Mindstorms products,
 the leJOS software, and programming in general. Through trial and error and the examples
 of others, we were able to complete our task of getting these four robots "user friendly".

It was great being able to tell people that our job requires us to play with legos all day,
 and to an extent, that is true.  The LEGO Mindstorms products really are regular lego pieces
 mixed in with some extra special pieces such as the gears and sensors.  With these pieces,
 these toys from our childhood, we were able to create real moving, interacting robots. We
 learned the physics and importance of big gears versus little gears and regular solid blocks
 versus blocks with axle holes through them.  We also learned that you need a good, sturdy, adaptable
 frame to make a good, working robot.  The LEGO Mindstorms products made us dig down through all
 the proper and restrictive red tape society has put on us as adults to our inner child and
 true imagination!

leJOS
</font>
<p>
We already had a decent understanding of Sun's version Java and how it works, but with leJOS we
 were able to learn a new twist on Java.  LeJOS kept our minds open to new programming skills,
 languages, and techniques.  It was also very useful in programming the RCX.  LeJOS allows you
 to do so much with so little effort if you really sit down and think about it.  You want the RCX
 to move forward, then the command is forward()!  That's it!  You're able to get extremely specific
 with it since the code corresponds to the labeling on the RCX brick itself.  You want to do something
 with the motor attached to port A?  Ok, simply use Motor.A and you're ready to go!

Programming in General

As mentioned above, leJOS kept our minds open to new skills, languages, and techniques while it also used
 the same syntax, the same format as Java.  In this manner, we were able to learn even more about the
 capabilites of Java and ourselves as programmers.  It taught us that we are capable of teaching ourselves
 a new way of doing things.  You can teach old dogs new tricks!

Overall

<p>
Overall, this research project was quite successful.  We accomplished so much in so little time!  If you
 don't believe us, then you haven't looked around this site enough!  This website has been the main place
 to write up documentation on the research and has been developed along side the research.  But the real test
 of whether we were successful or not will be when we let the intro programmers get their hands on the robots.
 So we'll just have to wait and see!

Special thanks to Meredith College Undergraduate Research Committee and the leJOS discussion mailing list
 for making this research possible and go so smoothly!  Thanks everyone!
