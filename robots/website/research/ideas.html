The main purpose for this research is to learn how these robots can be used for intro programmers,
 but we would also like to learn what all these robots are capable of and seeing how they can go
 above and beyond the beginner level.  Here are some of the other goals Dr Koster and Rebecca
 would like to achieve along side their main objective.

Navigation
</font>
<p>
As of right now, we are unable to truly navigate around a room or building.  We call tell the robot
 to move in a direction for a specified period of time but that isn't really navigating.  To navigate
 is to plan, record, and control the course and position of (a ship or aircraft or robot in this case).
 In other words, we must be able to get from point A to point B and be able to return to our starting
 position.  The TimingNavigator class using the Navigator interface allows us to do this with no extra
 parts unlike the RotationNavigator which requires two rotation sensors that we lack at this point. So
 we need to understand the TimingNavigator class to be able to run around a room or building successfully.

Vision
</font>
<p>
Wouldn't it be neat to give the robot eyes that could actually see what's in front of it? Think of all the
 possiblities!  We could make it collect items that are scattered around a room or we could make it be
 a motion detector and take snap shots or turn on a light when movement is detected.  There's so much
 we could do with the gift of sight, of vision!  It's not that outrageous though.  Using a webcamera and
 the LEGO Vision Command software or leJOS's equivalent thereof, we <i>can</i> give the robot eyes.

Communications
</font>
<p>
Unfortunately, the amount of memory is lacking on the RCX so by itself the RCX is unable to execute huge,
 complex calculations and programs.  The solution for this is communications, the ability to communicate
 IR tower to RCX and RCX to RCX.  For example, you want your RCX to be able to solve a Rubik's Cube which
 would require a lot of memory to know all six sides and then perform the calculations to solve the puzzle.
 This project has been done before.  How you ask?  The programmer had all the analyzing and calculating done
 on the PC then transfered via the IR tower the procedure to solve the puzzle to the RCX.  To have the ability
 to communicate back and forth from IR tower to RCX while a program is running would be extremely helpful in
 expanding the potential of these robots.
