Hopefully, the end result of this research will be the use of the LEGO Mindstorms robots
 as lab assignments for first semester programmers here at Meredith College.  The type of
 programs the students will be attempting to complete will be simple programs that demonstrate
 the students' understanding of level one programming skills such as method calls, if
 statements, and loops.
</p>

Method Calls
</font>
<p>
To test their understanding of method calls which are vital to Java programming, the students
 could make the RCX walk in a square or hexagon.  They would have to call the methods in the
 Move class Fwd(double seconds), Bwd(double seconds), turnRight(double seconds),
 turnLeft(double seconds), and Stop(double seconds).
</p>
<br>

<font size="4">
If Statements
</font>
<p>
To test if statements, the students could be instructed to make the RCX react in different ways
 IF a touch sensor is bumped.  The RCX could backup and turn a small angle or it could do a 180
 and turn around completely or stop both motors and make a sound such as a beep.
</p>
<br>

<font size="4">
Loops
</font>
<p>
To test loops, the students could make the RCX have 5 collisions before stopping all movement. They
 could do that using all 3 types of loops: while, do-while, and for.
</p>
<br>

<p>
If the students find these assignments to be too easy, we can always add a few more sensors and make
 the assignments more difficult.  We might even be able to have them do some of the more advanced
 programs that were done by Rebecca Fosdick such as the Table program or Thrower program.
