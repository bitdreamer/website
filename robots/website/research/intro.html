How did we get started?
</font>
<p>
It all got started with Dr. Koster and his ambitions to improve the Math and Computer
 Science Department and its facilities I suppose. I do know how I, Rebecca Fosdick,
 got involved. Being one of Dr. Koster's students he offered me the opportunity to
 work with robots over the summer of 2003 and get paid for it! I was sold immediately.
 We filled out the application and turned it in to the Undergraduate Research Committee
 the day of the deadline. In the application, they asked us what we would be doing,
 why we would be doing it, how we would be doing it, and when we would be doing it.
 I had to write a page explaining how I thought this research project would benefit me
 and why I should participate in the research. A few weeks later they gave us the approval
 and the grant money we needed, then we had to wait for May 12 (our starting date)
 to roll around...

What are we doing exactly?
</font>
<p>
Basically, we're programming LEGO Mindstorms robots. But why? There are many purposes
 behind this research. First off, we had to figure out how to program the robot in Java.
 That means we have to find some software that allows us to do this and install it then
 figure out how the software works.  Once we accomplish that, we can look into writing
 some basic Java programs to see what all they can do.  With a good general idea of the
 robot's capablities, we should be able to use them as lab assignments for intro programmers
 here at Meredith College. The hard part is designing the robot so that the intro students
 will have no problem using them in their labs. And that is our main goal.

How are we going to do that?

<p>
The robot came with the LEGO software meant for ages 11+ which just wouldn't do at all.
 Although, we did mess with it for the first afternoon we had the robot just to see what
 it could do. So after a little research online, we found a tool called leJOS that can
 override the LEGO software and allow you to program the robot in Java! We downloaded and
 installed leJOS to our computer and began looking into how leJOS works, how it lets us
 write programs in Java and how to get the programs to the robot. We found out that leJOS
 is quite complicated but do-able. It uses Java syntax but totally different commands, which
 means that we had to basically learn a new programming language. So why then is it still called
 Java?  Because Java is a very flexible programming language; it's very easy to reproduce and
 manipulate with the proper compiler and interpreter which leJOS has. Having a basic understanding
 of how Java works, you can learn the essentials of leJOS pretty easily. Once we understand leJOS,
 we can start writing real programs such as walk around a table without falling off and walk through
 a maze successfully to more fully understand the capabilities of leJOS. The next step is figuring
 out how an intro programmer could use leJOS to program the robot to do similiar tasks without using
 concepts they wouldn't know yet and utilizing concepts they do know and are learning presently.
 Since leJOS is pretty complicated even for simple navigation, we had to write our own Java classes
 using leJOS in a more simple manner. For example, to move forward for 5 seconds uses try and catch
 blocks and exceptions which you don't learn until the end of your second semester here at Meredith.
 We want first semester programmers to be able to use them as well so we had to write the Sleep and Move
 classes that sort of hide the try and catch blocks and exceptions from the eyes of the intro programmers.
 (See the <a href="http://www.geocities.com/funstuff841/robots/research/programs.html" target="main">Programs</a>
 page under the UnderGrad Research Project category for more information on the Sleep and Move classes.)

So what's next?
</font>
<p>
The sky is the limit!  But hopefully, at the end of these 8 weeks we will have a good enough understanding
 of leJOS and the robot to teach others and eventually the intro programmers.
