We've found that the tank design is best for a mobile robot with cornering abilities.
 Plus it looks cool.  Here are some of the designs we've used thus far in our research.

<td width="50%">
Here's your basic tank designed by the LEGO people. You can find instructions on how to
 build it in the booklet that comes with the Educational package.
</td>
<td width="50%">
The joys of the tank are that it can move pretty quickly but not run you down and that
 turning is very easy to do in it. Of course, it can't turn on a dime though.

The Tank with a Touch Sensor

<tr>
<td width="50%">
Another advantage of the tank designed by LEGO is that you can add front and rear
 attachments to it very easily like this single touch sensor.
</td>
<td width="50%">
With a design like this one, the sky's the limit!  It can simply be a bumper car or
 it can be a bulldozer and push things around.

<tr>
<td width="50%">
Here's a couple of our own attachments on the tank. This design was used specifically
 for the Table program. It can tell when either side are getting close to the edge,
 and it can tell when it bumps into something on the table!
</td>
<td width="50%">
Please notice there are no rear attachments therefore giving the robot tunnel vision
 so to speak.  It can't "see" anything behind it nor to the sides.

<tr>
<td width="50%">
This design is quite similiar to the one above as you can see. But this one has been
 modified to be used in the Maze program, which is still under construction.
</td>
<td width="50%">
The idea behind this design and the Maze program is that the outer most light sensor
 will watch for when it moves away from the reflective tape "walls" and the inner most
 light sensor will watch for when it moves too close to the reflective tape "walls".

<tr>
<td width="50%">
The Thrower model is designed especially for the Thrower program although it could
 easily be modified into a hammer design or something else of that nature.
</td>
<td width="50%">
This model uses three motors and a touch sensor, two motors for navigation and one
 for the arm to complete the throwing motion.

</td>

<tr>
<td width="50%">
This model is designed especially for the Pincher program.  (We're so original with our names.)
 Unfortunately, you have to be careful to choose objects that are relatively light for it to grab.
</td>
<td width="50%">
The Pincher model also takes three motors and a touch sensor in the same manner as the Thrower.
 With a fourth motor and some modifications, you could probably design the pincher to actually
 lift the object after grabbing it.

The Venus Tennis Ball Trap

</a>
</center>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td width="50%">
This model took a couple of days to design and build since originally it was going to have an arm with a claw on the end,
 but that didn't work out as planned.  Instead you have the funnel and trap door which seem to work just fine.
</td>
<td width="50%">
The Venus Tennis Ball Trap model gets its name from the fact that when something (namely a tennis ball) gets pushed inside
 the red bin, the yellow arm/trap door closes behind it locking the object inside.

Trilobot

</td>

<tr>
<td width="50%">
The Trilobot was designed by Brian Bagnall who is a co-founder of leJOS.  We got the design from his book <u>Core LEGO MINDSTORMS
 PROGRAMMING: Unleash the Power of the Java Platform</u>.  It's a very good book for those of you who would like more details on leJOS.
</td>
<td width="50%">
We plan use this model with the intro programmers.  It's low to the ground with the motors on the back, the low number of gears means
 it moves faster than the Tank, and it has 2 1x2 bricks with axle holes on the front for sensor attachments.
