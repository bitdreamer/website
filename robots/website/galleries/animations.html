All animations are in .avi format and should play in most IE versions and probably
 Netscape as well.  They should also play in Windows Media Player along with other
 media players.  If you want to save the clip, right click on the image and choose
 "Save Target As..." not "Save Picture As..." as that will only save the image and
 not the video clip.  NOTE: Sometimes after playing a clip in the web browser, it'll
 stubborn about going to another page.  Try refreshing then clicking on another link.
