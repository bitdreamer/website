These are the sensors that come with the Educational package:
 two light sensors, two touch sensors, a LED light, and two motors.
 The camera is an optional item for an additional charge of course.

The light sensor the way it comes in the box. It measures the percentage
 of light in front of it so basically, it sees in black and white.

This is the way the book suggests you mount it, but of course, it's only good
 if you have those little green pieces with the cross-shaped holes in them hehe.

The touch sensor, or bumper sensor, the way it comes in the box. It measures
 a boolean value: 0 for no bump and 1 for it touched something.
</td>
<td width="50%">
This is a good way to mount a single touch sensor. The book also gives you a way
 to mount a touch sensor on each side of the RCX. As with the light sensor, this
 only works if you have those green pieces.

I'm not exactly sure what you would use this for except to make sure that the sensor
 you want is activated. By placing the LED on top of the sensor, you can tell if the
 sensor is activated because the LED light will be on. NOTE: Take the LED off to run
 the program to its fullest.

Obviously, this is a motor. To make a robot that has turn abilities, you'll need
 at least two motors.  The motors have four settings: forward, backward, float, off.

The LEGO camera can be used as the RCX's "eyes". A common use for the camera is a motion detector.
 The LEGO wireless camera is recommended for use on mobile designs.
