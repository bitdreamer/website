<p>Dr. Barry Koster, a Computer Science professor at 
Meredith College, and Rebecca Fosdick, Class of 2006 at 
Meredith College, began working on the "Robots in Class" Undergraduate 
Research project in the summer of 2003.  Working with the LEGO 
Mindstorms robots, their main objective is to enhance the teaching 
of Meredith's programming sequence by coming up with lab assignments 
for CSC1 students.
